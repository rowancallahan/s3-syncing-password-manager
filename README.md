# A Self Hosted Syncing Password Manager for S3

I have been looking for a password manager similar to Enpass that is open source, works with s3 for self hosting and syncing and has encryption. This is my first version of an electron app with those features.

To build simply download and run 

```{bash}

npm install
npm build

```

It requires node to be installed.


### N.B.
Currently a large portion of this app has been vibe coded and it may not be ready yet for heavy use. I will update this readme after I have checked through the code and added more testing.
